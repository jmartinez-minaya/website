Under Mediterranean conditions, P. nawae forms pseudothecia in the leaf litter in winter, and ascospores are released in spring, infecting susceptible leaves. Persimmon growers are advised to apply fungicides for CLS control during the period of inoculum availability, which was previously defined based on ascospore counts under the microscope. A model of inoculum availability of P. nawae was developed and evaluated as an alternative to ascospore counts. Leaf litter samples were collected weekly in L‚ÄôAlc√∫dia (Spain) from 2010 to 2015. Leaves were soaked and placed in a wind tunnel, and the released ascospores of P. nawae were counted. Hierarchical Bayesian beta regression methods were used to model the dynamics of ascospore production in the leaf litter. The selected model included accumulated degree-days (ADDs) and ADDs taking into account the vapor pressure deficit (ADDvpd) as fixed effects and year as random effect. This model had a mean absolute error of 0.042 and a root mean square error of 0.062. The beta regression model was evaluated in four orchards from 2010 to 2015. Higher accuracy was obtained at the beginning and the end of the ascospore production period, which are the events of interest to schedule fungicide sprays for CLS control in Spain. This same modeling framework can be extended to other fungal plant pathogens whose inoculum dynamics are expressed as proportion data.","tags":["Decision Support System","Ecology and Epidemiology","Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)","Micology","Mycosphaerella nawae","Warning System"],"title":"Modeling Inoculum Availability of Plurivorosphaerella nawae in Persimmon Leaf Litter with Bayesian Beta Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project shows how the use of Bayesian hierarchical models can help in the establishment of measures for plant diseases control.

In Alicante, Spain, almond leaf scorch, caused by X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex, was detected in 2017. The effects of climatic and spatial factors on the geographic distribution of X. fastidiosa in these two infested regions in Europe were studied. The presence/absence data of X. fastidiosa in the official surveys were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models through the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methodology. Climatic covariates were obtained from the WorldClim v.2 database. A categorical variable was also included according to Purcell‚Äôs minimum winter temperature thresholds for the risk of occurrence of Pierce‚Äôs disease of grapevine, caused by X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa. In Alicante, data were presented aggregated on a 1 km grid (lattice data), where the spatial effect was included in the model through a conditional autoregressive structure. In Lecce, data were observed at continuous locations occurring within a defined spatial domain (geostatistical data). Therefore, the spatial effect was included via the stochastic partial differential equation approach. In Alicante, the pathogen was detected in all four of Purcell‚Äôs categories, illustrating the environmental plasticity of the subsp. multiplex. Here, none of the climatic covariates were retained in the selected model. Only two of Purcell‚Äôs categories were represented in Lecce. The mean diurnal range (bio2) and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter (bio8) were retained in the selected model, with a negative relationship with the presence of the pathogen. However, this may be due to the heterogeneous sampling distribution having a confounding effect with the climatic covariates. In both regions, the spatial structure had a strong influence on the models, but not the climatic covariates. Therefore, pathogen distribution was largely defined by the spatial relationship between geographic locations. This substantial contribution of the spatial effect in the models might indicate that the current extent of X. fastidiosa in the study regions had arisen from a single focus or from several foci, which have been coalesced.","tags":["hierarchical Bayesian models","integrated nested Laplace approximation","stochastic partial differential equation","Xylella fastidiosa","species distribution models","olive quick decline","almond leaf scorch"],"title":"Spatial Bayesian Modeling Applied to the Surveys of Xylella fastidiosa in Alicante (Spain) and Apulia (Italy)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neus Marimon","Iban Eduardo","Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez-Minaya","Antonio Vicent","Jordi Luque"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593993600,"objectID":"568457d4ff8132f767d1cba946b0c74f","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/marimon_2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marimon_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The incidence of peach powdery mildew (PPM) on fruit was monitored in commercial peach orchards to i) describe the disease progress in relation to several environmental parameters and ii) establish an operating threshold to initiate a fungicide spray program based on accumulated degree-day (ADD) data.

The use of decision support systems (DSSs) may assist to optimize fungicide programs to enhance application on the basis of risk associated with disease outbreak. Case-by-case evaluations demonstrated the performance of DSSs for disease control, but an overall assessment of the efficacy of DSSs is lacking. A literature review was conducted to synthesize the results of 67 experiments assessing DSSs. Disease incidence data were obtained from published peer-reviewed field trials comparing untreated controls, calendar-based and DSS-based fungicide programs. Two meta-analysis generic models, a ‚Äúfixed-effects‚Äù vs. a ‚Äúrandom-effects‚Äù model within the framework of generalized linear models were evaluated to assess the efficacy of DSSs in reducing incidence. All models were fit using both frequentist and Bayesian estimation procedures and the results compared. Model including random effects showed better performance in terms of AIC or DIC and goodness of fit. In general, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches produced similar results. Odds ratio and incidence ratio values showed that calendar-based and DSS-based fungicide programs considerably reduced disease incidence compared to the untreated control. Moreover, calendar-based and DSS-based programs provided similar reductions in disease incidence, further supporting the efficacy of DSSs.","tags":["Bayesian models","confidence/credibility intervals","disease management","epidemiological models","generalized linear mixed models","incidence ratio","JAGS software","predictive distribution","odds ratio"],"title":"Comparison of Frequentist and Bayesian Meta-Analysis Models for Assessing the Efficacy of Decision Support Systems in Reducing Fungal Disease Incidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez-Minaya","Finn Lindgren","Antonio L√≥pez-Qu√≠lez","Daniel Simpson","David Conesa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582502400,"objectID":"4a99401e6376d1889de54a9e1eb8b109","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/martinez-minaya_2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martinez-minaya_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces a Laplace approximation to Bayesian inference in regression models for multivariate response variables. We focus on Dirichlet regression models, which can be used to analyze a set of variables on a simplex exhibiting skewness and heteroscedasticity, without having to transform the data. These data, which mainly consist of proportions or percentages of disjoint categories, are widely known as compositional data and are common in areas such as ecology, geology, and psychology. We provide both the theoretical foundations and a description of how this Laplace approximation can be implemented in the case of Dirichlet regression. The paper also introduces the package dirinla in the R-language that extends the R-INLA package, which can not deal directly with multivariate likelihoods like the Dirichlet likelihood. Simulation studies are presented to validate the good behaviour of the proposed method, while a real data case-study is used to show how this approach can be applied.","tags":["Hierarchical Bayesian models","INLA","Dirichlet regression","multivariate likelihood"],"title":"The Integrated nested Laplace approximation for fitting models with multivariate response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez-Minaya","David Conesa","Haakon Bakka","Maria Grazia Pennino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566604800,"objectID":"cfd398c93109ff8889dba1211f8c87f1","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/martinez-minaya_2019b/","publishdate":"2019-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martinez-minaya_2019b/","section":"publication","summary":"Worldwide, cetacean species have started to be protected, but they are still very vulnerable to accidental damage from an expanding range of human activities at sea. To properly manage these potential threats we need a detailed understanding of the seasonal distributions of these highly mobile populations. To achieve this goal, a growing effort has been underway to develop species distribution models (SDMs) that correctly describe and predict preferred species areas. However, accuracy is not always easy to achieve when physical barriers, such as islands, are present. Indeed, SDMs assume, if only implicitly, that the spatial effect is stationary, and that correlation is only dependent on the distance between observations and not on the direction or a spatial coordinates. The application of stationary SDMs in these cases could lead to incorrect predictions and, consequently, to uninformed decision making. In this study, we identify vulnerable habitats for the bottlenose dolphin in the Archipelago de La Maddalena, Northern Sardinia (Italy) using Bayesian hierarchical SDMs that account for the physical barriers issue and provide a full specification of the associated uncertainty. The approach we propose constitutes a major step forward in the understanding of cetacean species in many ecosystems where physical, geographical and topographical barriers are present.","tags":["Archipelago de La Maddalena","Cetaceans","Hierarchical Bayesian spatial models","INLA","SPDE"],"title":" Dealing with physical barriers in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Multiple efforts are currently focused on the development of models to better predict distribution range shifts due to GCC. We addressed this issue by including intraspecific genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of data in distribution range models. Both factors reflect the joint effect of ecoevolutionary processes on the geographical heterogeneity of populations. We used a collection of 301 georeferenced accessions of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in its Iberian Peninsula range, where the species shows strong geographical genetic structure. We developed spatial and nonspatial hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) to depict current and future distribution ranges for the four genetic clusters detected. We also compared the performance of HBMs with Maxent (a presence-only model). Maxent and nonspatial HBMs presented some shortcomings, such as the loss of accessions with high genetic admixture in the case of Maxent and the presence of residual SAC for both. As spatial HBMs removed residual SAC, these models showed higher accuracy than nonspatial HBMs and handled the spatial effect on model outcomes. The ease of modelling and the consistency among model outputs for each genetic cluster was conditioned by the sparseness of the populations across the distribution range. Our HBMs enrich the toolbox of software available to evaluate GCC-induced distribution range shifts by considering both genetic heterogeneity and SAC, two inherent properties of any organism that should not be overlooked.","tags":["Arabidopsis thaliana","geographical genetic structure","global climate change","hierarchical Bayesian models","Maxent","spatial autocorrelation"],"title":"A hierarchical Bayesian Beta regression approach to study the effects of geographical genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation on species distribution range shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez-Minaya"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')     print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

This complexity has made the inferential and predictive processes challenging to perform. The Bayesian approach has become a good option to deal with these models due to the ease with which prior information can be incorporated along with the fact that it provides a more realistic and accurate estimation of uncertainty. In this paper, we first review the sources of information and different approaches (frequentist and Bayesian) to model the distribution of a species. We also discuss the Integrated Nested Laplace approximation as a tool with which to obtain marginal posterior distributions of the parameters involved in these models. We finally discuss some important statistical issues that arise when researchers use species data: the presence of a temporal effect (presenting different spatial and spatio-temporal structures), preferential sampling, spatial misalignment, non-stationarity, imperfect detection, and the excess of zeros.","tags":["Geostatistics","Hierarchical Bayesian models","INLA","Point processes","Preferential sampling","SPDE"],"title":"Species distribution modeling: a statistical review with focus in spatio-temporal issues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez-Minaya","David Conesa","Antonio L√≥pez-Qu√≠lez","Antonio Vicent"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519257600,"objectID":"cbfec219beebc0ff7dc2e4f035144842","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/martinez-minaya_2018b/","publishdate":"2018-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martinez-minaya_2018b/","section":"publication","summary":"Citrus black spot (CBS), caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa, is the main fungal disease affecting this crop and quarantine measures have been implemented. The role of climate as a limiting factor for the establishment and spread of CBS to new areas has been debated, but previous studies did not address the effects of spatial factors in the geographic distribution of the disease. The effects of climatic and spatial factors were studied using South Africa as a case study, due to its diversity of climates within citrus-growing regions. Georeferenced datasets of CBS presence/absence in citrus areas were assembled for two stages of the epidemic: 1950 and 2014. Climatic variables were obtained from the WorldClim database. Moran‚Äôs I and Geary‚Äôs C analyses indicated that CBS distribution data presented significant spatial autocorrelation, particularly in 2014. Collinearity was detected among climatic variables. Spatial logistic regressions, particular case of latent Gaussian models, were fitted to CBS presence/absence in 1950 or 2014 with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation methodology. Principal components (PCs) or pre-selection of climatic variables based on their correlation coefficients were used to cope with collinearity. Spatial effects were incorporated with a geostatistical term. In general, the models indicated a positive relationship between CBS presence and climatic variables or PCs associated with warm temperatures and high precipitation. Nevertheless, in 1950, models that also included a spatial effect outperformed those with climatic variables only. Problems of model convergence were detected in 2014 due to the strong spatial structure of CBS distribution data. The consequences of ignoring spatial dependence to estimate the potential geographical range of CBS are discussed.","tags":["Guignardia citricarpa","Geostatistics","INLA","Biogeography","Risk assessment"],"title":"Spatial and climatic factors associated with the geographical distribution of citrus black spot disease in South Africa.

(European Journal of Plant Pathology 143, 69‚Äì83, 2015) performed an analysis of climate-based distribution of citrus black spot (CBS) in South Africa. It was found that CBS was initially confined to humid areas with summer rainfall, but later spread to arid steppe and even desert climates. A strong spatial autocorrelation of CBS distribution was found. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) take a critical view of our study, but without presenting any analysis of results to refute our findings. Furthermore, Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appear to have misunderstood our work, since many of their criticisms relate to the potential distribution of CBS in Europe, which is beyond the scope of our original study. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) highlight the limitations of climate classifications in species distribution modelling. However, this was made explicit in our study, indicating that it was a preparatory work and further advanced modelling studies, including spatial effects, will be needed. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) incorrectly assume that we used all of South Africa as the background in the spatial autocorrelation analysis. However, only citrus areas were used and a strong spatial autocorrelation was detected at all distances evaluated. Contrary to what Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) suggest, similar climate distributions of CBS were obtained at 5‚Ä≤ and 30‚Ä≤ resolution, and also with the national land-cover map of South Africa. The figure comparison presented by Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appears to ignore the fact that the maps we used were grid cells of 10 √ó 10 km and not the line polygons they suggest. Therefore, we consider the conclusions from the Mart√≠nez-Minaya et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology 143, 69‚Äì83, 2015) remain entirely valid.","tags":["Guignardia citricarpa","Spatial autocorrelation","Mapping"],"title":"Response to the letter on 'Climatic distribution of citrus black spot caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa.

The Mediterranean Basin is free of the disease and thus phytosanitary measures are in place to avoid the entry of P. citricarpa in the EU territory. However, the suitability of the climates present in the Mediterranean Basin for CBS establishment and spread is debated. As a case study, an analysis of climate types and environmental variables in South Africa was conducted to identify potential associations with CBS distribution. The spread of the disease was traced and georeferenced datasets of CBS distribution and environmental variables were assembled. In 1950 CBS was still confined to areas of temperate climates with summer rainfall (Cw, Cf), but spread afterwards to neighbouring regions with markedly drier conditions. Actually, the hot arid steppe (BSh) is the predominant climate where CBS develops in South Africa nowadays. The disease was not detected in the Mediterranean-type climates Csa and Csb as defined by the K√∂ppen-Geiger system and the more restrictive Aschmann‚Äôs classification criteria. However, arid steppe (BS) climates, where CBS is prevalent in South Africa, are common in important citrus areas in the Mediterranean Basin. The most noticeable change in the environmental range occupied by CBS in South Africa was the amount and seasonality of rainfall. Due to the spread of the disease to dryer regions, the minimum annual precipitation in CBS-affected areas declined from 663 mm in 1950 to 339 mm at present. The minimum value precipitation of warmest quarter also declined from 290 to 96 mm. Strong spatial autocorrelation in CBS distribution data was detected, so further modelling efforts should consider the relative contribution of environmental variables and spatial effects to estimate the potential geographical range of CBS.","tags":["Guignardia citricarpa","Risk assessment","Species distribution","Biogeography","Plant health"],"title":"Climatic distribution of citrus black spot caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa.

abstract: In a previous study, Martínez-Minaya et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology 143, 69–83, 2015) performed an analysis of climate-based distribution of citrus black spot (CBS) in South Africa. It was found that CBS was initially confined to humid areas with summer rainfall, but later spread to arid steppe and even desert climates. A strong spatial autocorrelation of CBS distribution was found. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) take a critical view of our study, but without presenting any analysis of results to refute our findings. Furthermore, Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appear to have misunderstood our work, since many of their criticisms relate to the potential distribution of CBS in Europe, which is beyond the scope of our original study. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) highlight the limitations of climate classifications in species distribution modelling. However, this was made explicit in our study, indicating that it was a preparatory work and further advanced modelling studies, including spatial effects, will be needed. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) incorrectly assume that we used all of South Africa as the background in the spatial autocorrelation analysis. However, only citrus areas were used and a strong spatial autocorrelation was detected at all distances evaluated. Contrary to what Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) suggest, similar climate distributions of CBS were obtained at 5′ and 30′ resolution, and also with the national land-cover map of South Africa. The figure comparison presented by Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appears to ignore the fact that the maps we used were grid cells of 10 × 10 km and not the line polygons they suggest. Therefore, we consider the conclusions from the Martínez-Minaya et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology 143, 69–83, 2015) remain entirely valid.

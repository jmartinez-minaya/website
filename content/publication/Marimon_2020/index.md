abstract: "The incidence of peach powdery mildew (PPM) on fruit was monitored in commercial peach orchards to i) describe the disease progress in relation to several environmental parameters and ii) establish an operating threshold to initiate a fungicide spray program based on accumulated degree-day (ADD) data. A beta-regression model for disease incidence showed a substantial contribution of the random effects orchard and year, whereas relevant fixed effects corresponded to ADD, wetness duration, and ADD considering vapor pressure deficit and rain. When beta-regression models were fitted for each orchard and year considering only ADD, disease onset was observed at 242 ± 13 ADD and symptoms did not develop further after 484 ± 42 ADD. An operating threshold to initiate fungicide applications was established at 220 ADD, coinciding with a PPM incidence in fruit around 0.05. A validation was further conducted by comparing PPM incidence in i) a standard, calendar-based program, ii) a program with applications initiated at 220 ADD, and iii) a nontreated control. A statistically relevant reduction in disease incidence in fruit was obtained with both fungicide programs, from 0.244 recorded in the control to 0.073 with the 220-ADD alert program, and 0.049 with the standard program. The 220-ADD alert program resulted in 33% reduction in fungicide applications."
